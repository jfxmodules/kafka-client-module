kafka-clients-module

The initial commit for this project was taken from the Apache Kafka project 
(https://github.com/apache/kafka/tree/3.7.0)

The code for the initial commit was taken from tag 3.7.0. This project is just
the Kafka clients code. All changes made to the original code base can be seen
in the diff.out file contained in the root of this project.

I've included the original Notice.txt below, however some of it does not apply
here because this is just a small part of the overall Kafka code base. This 
repository does not have a dependency on jersey or jqwik. It also does not have
scala and therefore no dependency on Lightbend. No dependency on Hive either.
